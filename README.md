<h3>How to translate the software to your language: </h3>
Download the source code available. <br>
From here use a text editor and translate the english phrases in the qoutes to your language. <br>
After that make a issue with the label <b>Translation</b> with the file. <br>
If the translation will be accepted, in the next version that will be published you'll find your username in the credits section with the respective language translated.

<h3>About the software</h3>
For someone who likes to try older version of the software, the software is still compatible with the first version! <br>
Skaled AI was not meant to be included in an another software. <br>
The first release was published the 09/11/2022. <br>
Core is the name I like best for a software that includes more. <br>
If you could see it, I've released for just a moment v1.4.0 before than the really one that has just got published. <br>
This software is the successor of Skaled Manager, was the same idea but it came not how I wanted it.
