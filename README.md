**How updates will work?** <br>
v1.number (ex. 1) - Important update, that includes a lot of features that work properly <br>
v1.1.number (ex. 1) - Update that includes some experimental features still in development <br>
**Note:** I will only set to latest release the first one of the list, but there are others release available.

**FAQ:** <br>
Q: Why you don't set at latest every new release? <br>
A: Because are experimental features that when a new stable update will come they will be stable, and don't might cause the software to crash.
